title: "How to Communicate with the Cobalt Team"
---

We have several communication channels that we actively support, each for
different purposes.

## Filing Bugs and Feature Requests

What goes here? 

## Asking Technical Questions

For programming related technical questions about Starboard or Cobalt, we
encourage you to search through and post questions on [Stack
Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) (SO). The team actively monitors for
Cobalt-tagged questions on SO.

Stack Overflow has guidelines about what kinds of questions are acceptable. In
particular, they should be about some aspect of **coding**, and not questions
about schedules, future plans, certifications and so on. Additionally, they
should not be bug reports or feature requests, those should be filed on our
public Issue Tracker.

## Asking about Schedules, Discussing Features, Announcements, and Miscellany

We also have a dedicated mailing list, cobalt-dev@googlegroups.com. If you are
spending time with Cobalt, you may want to subscribe. And if you have a concern
that doesn't fit into the above categories, asking about it on cobalt-dev is a
reasonable course of action.

## YouTube Topics

If you are using Cobalt for YouTube on your device, and have YouTube-specific
questions, you should contact your YouTube technical account manager
directly. The above forums are Cobalt-specific, but not YouTube-specific.  The
Cobalt engineering team can't speak on behalf of Google or YouTube.
